Wesnoth ladder friends list synchronization
===========================================

This script lets you synchronize the ladder users to your wesnoth profile, so ladder players are highlighted in the multiplayer lobby.  
The resulting friends have an attached comment so they are distinguished from your manually set friends.


```bash
# Usage: wesnoth_ladder_friends.sh <mode> [preffile]
#
#  mode:     mode to operate in:
#            - "add":        add LoW members
#            - "add-ladder": add just the active ladder rated members from ladder page
#            - "clean":      clean LoW members from list
#  preffile: optional path to preferences file, otherwise automatically determined
```
